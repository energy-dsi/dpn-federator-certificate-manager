# Vault Integration

This document describes how the Federator Certificate Manager integrates with HashiCorp Vault for secret persistence and retrieval.

---

## Overview

The service uses **Vault KV v2** (versioned key-value) as the persistent store for all cryptographic material. Communication is handled through Spring Cloud Vault's `VaultTemplate`, which provides typed operations against the Vault HTTP API.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Certificate Manager"
        VSP[VaultSecretProviderImpl]
        VT[VaultTemplate]
    end

    subgraph "HashiCorp Vault"
        KV["KV v2 Engine<br/>(mount: pki-client)"]
        subgraph "Secret Paths"
            KP["node-net/client/keypair"]
            CERT["node-net/client/certificate"]
            CA["node-net/client/ca-chain"]
            ICA["node-net/client/intermediate-ca"]
            KSP["node-net/client/keystore-password"]
            TSP["node-net/client/truststore-password"]
        end
    end

    VSP --> VT
    VT --> KV
    KV --> KP
    KV --> CERT
    KV --> CA
    KV --> ICA
    KV --> KSP
    KV --> TSP
```

## Secret Path Structure

All secrets are stored under `{pki-mount}/data/{secret-path}/{suffix}` using Vault KV v2 semantics.

Given default configuration:
- **Mount:** `pki-client`
- **Base path:** `node-net/client`

| Suffix | Full KV v2 Path | Fields | Description |
|--------|-----------------|--------|-------------|
| `keypair` | `pki-client/data/node-net/client/keypair` | `publicKey`, `privateKey` | RSA key pair in PEM format (PKCS#8 private key, X.509 public key) |
| `certificate` | `pki-client/data/node-net/client/certificate` | `certificate` | Leaf X.509 certificate in PEM format |
| `ca-chain` | `pki-client/data/node-net/client/ca-chain` | `chain` | Newline-delimited PEM certificates (full CA chain) |
| `intermediate-ca` | `pki-client/data/node-net/client/intermediate-ca` | `certificate` | Intermediate CA certificate in PEM format |
| `keystore-password` | `pki-client/data/node-net/client/keystore-password` | `password` | Plaintext password for the PKCS#12 keystore |
| `truststore-password` | `pki-client/data/node-net/client/truststore-password` | `password` | Plaintext password for the PKCS#12 truststore |

## Operations

### Mount Verification

On first use, `VaultSecretProviderImpl` verifies the KV mount exists:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant VSP as VaultSecretProviderImpl
    participant VT as VaultTemplate
    participant Vault as HashiCorp Vault

    VSP->>VT: vaultSysOperations().getMounts()
    VT->>Vault: GET /sys/mounts
    Vault-->>VT: Map of mount points
    VT-->>VSP: Map<String, VaultMount>

    alt Mount exists at "pki-client/"
        VSP->>VSP: kvMountVerified = true (cached)
    else Mount not found
        VSP->>VSP: throw VaultException("KV mount not found")
    end
```

This check is performed once and cached in a `volatile boolean` field. Subsequent calls skip the verification.

### Write Operations

All write operations use `VaultKeyValueOperationsSupport.KeyValueBackend.KV_2`:

```java
vaultTemplate
    .opsForKeyValue(mountPath, KV_2)
    .put(relativePath, dataMap);
```

| Method | Path Suffix | Data Map |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| `persistKeyPair(pub, priv)` | `keypair` | `{ "publicKey": "...", "privateKey": "..." }` |
| `persistCertificate(cert)` | `certificate` | `{ "certificate": "..." }` |
| `persistCaChain(chain)` | `ca-chain` | `{ "chain": "...\\n..." }` |
| `persistIntermediateCa(cert)` | `intermediate-ca` | `{ "certificate": "..." }` |
| `persistKeystorePassword(pw)` | `keystore-password` | `{ "password": "..." }` |
| `persistTruststorePassword(pw)` | `truststore-password` | `{ "password": "..." }` |

### Read Operations

Read operations retrieve data from the same paths and extract specific fields:

```java
VaultResponse response = vaultTemplate
    .opsForKeyValue(mountPath, KV_2)
    .get(relativePath);
return response.getData().get(fieldName);
```

| Method | Path Suffix | Returns |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `getKeyPair()` | `keypair` | `Map { publicKey, privateKey }` |
| `getCertificate()` | `certificate` | `String` (PEM) |
| `getCaChain()` | `ca-chain` | `List<String>` (split PEM chain) |
| `getIntermediateCa()` | `intermediate-ca` | `String` (PEM) |
| `getKeystorePassword()` | `keystore-password` | `String` |
| `getTruststorePassword()` | `truststore-password` | `String` |

### CA Chain Splitting

The CA chain is stored as a single newline-delimited PEM string. On retrieval, it is split into individual certificates:

```
Input:  "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIIB...\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIIC...\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----"

Output: [
  "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIIB...\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----",
  "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIIC...\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----"
]
```

The splitting logic uses `-----END CERTIFICATE-----` as the delimiter and reconstructs proper PEM boundaries for each certificate.

## Vault ACL Policy

The minimum Vault policy required by the service:

```hcl
# Read and write certificate secrets
path "pki-client/data/node-net/client/*" {
  capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete"]
}

# List secrets (for diagnostics)
path "pki-client/metadata/node-net/client/*" {
  capabilities = ["read", "list"]
}

# Mount verification on startup
path "sys/mounts" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
```

Replace `pki-client` and `node-net/client` with your configured `pki-mount` and `secret-path` values.

---

## Error Handling

All Vault operations are wrapped in try-catch blocks that throw `VaultException`:

| Scenario | Exception Message | Behaviour |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| KV mount not found | `"KV mount {mount} not found in Vault"` | Fatal — service cannot persist secrets |
| Write failure | `"Failed to persist {type} to Vault"` | Propagated to caller, logged at ERROR |
| Read returns null | Returns `null` to caller | Caller decides (e.g., renewal job treats as "missing") |
| Connection failure | Spring Cloud Vault exception wrapped | Propagated as `VaultException` |

---

## Vault Connection Configuration

The Vault connection is configured through Spring Cloud Vault's standard properties:

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    vault:
      uri: https://vault.example.com:8200
      token: ${VAULT_TOKEN}
      # Additional options:
      connection-timeout: 5000
      read-timeout: 15000
      ssl:
        trust-store: /etc/certs/vault-truststore.jks
        trust-store-password: ${VAULT_TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD}
```

For production deployments, consider using Vault's AppRole or Kubernetes authentication instead of static tokens.

---

## Secret Versioning

Since the service uses KV v2, Vault automatically versions all secrets. The service always reads the **latest version**. Previous versions are retained according to the KV engine's configured `max_versions` setting.

To inspect secret versions:

```sh
# View metadata (all versions)
vault kv metadata get pki-client/node-net/client/certificate

# View a specific version
vault kv get -version=2 pki-client/node-net/client/certificate
```
