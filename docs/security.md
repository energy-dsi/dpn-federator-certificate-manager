# Security & mTLS

This document describes the security architecture of the Federator Certificate Manager, including mutual TLS (mTLS) configuration, OAuth2 client credentials flow, and token caching.

```

## Mutual TLS (mTLS)

All outbound HTTP calls to the Management Node and OAuth2 IdP are secured with mutual TLS. The service presents a client certificate and validates the server's certificate chain.

### How It Works

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant CM as Certificate Manager
    participant Server as Management Node / IdP

    CM->>Server: TLS ClientHello
    Server-->>CM: TLS ServerHello + Server Certificate
    CM->>CM: Validate server cert against truststore.jks
    Server->>CM: CertificateRequest
    CM-->>Server: Client Certificate (from keystore.jks)
    Server->>Server: Validate client cert
    Note over CM,Server: TLS handshake complete (mutual authentication)
    CM->>Server: HTTP request (encrypted)
    Server-->>CM: HTTP response (encrypted)
```

### Configuration

The mTLS `SSLContext` is built in `RestClientConfig`:

1. **Load client keystore** — Contains the client's private key and X.509 certificate
2. **Load truststore** — Contains CA certificates trusted by the client
3. **Build SSLContext** — Apache `SSLContextBuilder` with both key and trust material
4. **Configure HttpClient** — Apache HttpClient 5 with:
   - `DefaultClientTlsStrategy` using the SSLContext
   - Connection pool with timeout settings
   - Expired connection eviction

```yaml
application:
  client:
    key-store: /etc/certs/keystore.jks        # Client identity
    key-store-password: ${KEYSTORE_PASSWORD}
    trust-store: /etc/certs/truststore.jks     # Trusted CAs
    trust-store-password: ${TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD}
    key-store-type: JKS                        # JKS or PKCS12
```

### Important Distinction

There are **two sets of keystores** in this system:

| Keystore | Format | Purpose | Managed By |
|----------|--------|---------|------------|
| **Input** keystore.jks / truststore.jks | JKS | mTLS client identity for outbound calls | Operator (pre-provisioned) |
| **Output** keystore.p12 / truststore.p12 | PKCS#12 | Generated certificates for federator services | Certificate Manager (automated) |

The input keystores authenticate the Certificate Manager itself. The output keystores are the product of the certificate lifecycle management.

---

## OAuth2 Client Credentials Flow

The service authenticates with the Management Node API using OAuth2 Bearer tokens obtained via the client credentials grant.

### Token Acquisition Sequence

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant MNS as ManagementNodeService
    participant TCS as TokenCacheService
    participant OTS as OAuth2TokenService
    participant IdP as OAuth2 IdP

    MNS->>TCS: getToken()

    alt Token cached and valid (> 5 min remaining)
        TCS-->>MNS: cached JWT string
    else Token missing or expiring within 5 min
        TCS->>OTS: getAccessToken()
        OTS->>IdP: POST /token<br/>grant_type=client_credentials<br/>client_id=MANAGEMENT_NODE_CLIENT
        Note over OTS,IdP: Request sent over mTLS
        IdP-->>OTS: { "access_token": "eyJ...", "expires_in": 3600 }
        OTS-->>TCS: TokenResponse
        TCS->>TCS: Cache token (key: "currentToken")
        TCS-->>MNS: JWT string
    end

    MNS->>MNS: Set header: Authorization: Bearer eyJ...
```

### Token Request Details

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Method** | `POST` |
| **URL** | Configured `token-uri` |
| **Content-Type** | `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` |
| **grant_type** | `client_credentials` |
| **client_id** | Configured `client-id` |
| **Transport** | mTLS (client certificate used for client authentication) |

> The client authenticates using mTLS (the TLS client certificate) rather than a `client_secret`. This is the `tls_client_auth` method in OAuth2 terminology.

### Token Response

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIs...",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

The `TokenResponse` record captures:
- `accessToken` — The JWT string
- `expiresIn` — Seconds until expiry
- `expiryInstant` — Computed as `Instant.now() + expiresIn`

---

## Token Caching

Tokens are cached using Caffeine to avoid unnecessary IdP calls.

### Cache Configuration

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Cache name** | `tokenCache` | Caffeine cache instance |
| **Expiry after write** | 1 hour | Maximum TTL regardless of access pattern |
| **Maximum size** | 10 entries | Upper bound (only 1 entry used in practice) |
| **Cache key** | `"currentToken"` | Fixed key for the single cached token |

### Early Refresh Logic

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[getToken called] --> B{Cached token exists?}
    B -- No --> C[Call refreshToken]
    B -- Yes --> D{Expires within 300s?}
    D -- Yes --> C
    D -- No --> E[Return cached token]
    C --> F[OAuth2TokenService.getAccessToken]
    F --> G{Success?}
    G -- Yes --> H[Store in cache]
    H --> I[Return new token]
    G -- No --> J[Evict cache entry]
    J --> K[Throw OAuth2TokenException]
```

The `refreshToken()` method is `synchronized` to prevent multiple concurrent threads from requesting tokens simultaneously.

### Cache Eviction on Failure

If token acquisition fails, the cached entry is evicted (`cacheManager.getCache("tokenCache").evict("currentToken")`) so the next call attempts a fresh request rather than returning a stale/expired token.

## Management Node API Authentication

Both Management Node API calls carry the OAuth2 Bearer token:

### GET Intermediate Certificate

```http
GET /api/v1/certificate/intermediate HTTP/1.1
Host: management-node.example.com:8090
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIs...
```

### POST Sign CSR

```http
POST /api/v1/certificate/csr/sign HTTP/1.1
Host: management-node.example.com:8090
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIs...
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "csr": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----\nMIIC..."
}
```

---

## Certificate Verification

After receiving a signed certificate from the Management Node, the service verifies it before persistence:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Receive signed certificate] --> B[Parse leaf cert X.509]
    B --> C[Parse intermediate CA X.509]
    C --> D{cert.checkValidity at current time}
    D -- Invalid --> E[Throw PkiException]
    D -- Valid --> F{cert.verify using CA public key}
    F -- Failed --> G[Throw PkiException]
    F -- Passed --> H[Extract and log issuer CN]
    H --> I[Certificate verified]
```

This ensures the Management Node returned a certificate that:
1. Is currently within its validity period (`notBefore` ≤ now ≤ `notAfter`)
2. Was signed by the expected intermediate CA

---

## Vault Authentication

Vault uses **token-based authentication** (not mTLS). The token is provided via configuration:

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    vault:
      token: ${VAULT_TOKEN}
```

For production, consider:
- **AppRole authentication** — Machine-to-machine auth with role_id and secret_id
- **Kubernetes authentication** — Service account token-based auth for K8s deployments
- **Token renewal** — Ensure the Vault token TTL exceeds the application lifecycle or configure auto-renewal

---

## Security Considerations

### Secret Handling

| Secret | Storage | Rotation |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Vault token | Environment variable | Manual or via Vault auth method |
| mTLS keystore password | application.yml or env var | Manual |
| Generated keystore passwords | Vault KV v2 | Automatic (on first creation) |
| Private keys | Vault KV v2 (in memory during operation) | Automatic (on certificate renewal) |

### Filesystem Security

The generated PKCS#12 files and password files should be protected:

```sh
# Restrict access to the secrets directory
chmod 700 /etc/federator/secrets/
chmod 600 /etc/federator/secrets/*
chown app-user:app-group /etc/federator/secrets/*
```

### Network Security

- All Management Node and IdP communication uses mTLS (mutual authentication)
- Vault communication should use HTTPS in production (configure `spring.cloud.vault.ssl.*`)
- No inbound network listeners — the application does not expose any HTTP endpoints
